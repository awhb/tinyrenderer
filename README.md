# Tiny RayTracer

![Output Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awhb/tinyrenderer/main/output.tga)

A simple Ray Tracing program written in bare C++ following a [tutorial](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer). By doing this, I learned a lot about C++ and Graphics APIs! Recommend to check it out and implement if you are interested.
